This is my first android app! It's not much, I know. Onward to greatness!

to setup the app, run the following commands in your bash terminal (linux):

$chmod 777 setup.sh
$./setup.sh

now make sure usb debugging is enabled on your android phone: https://www.kingoapp.com/root-tutorials/how-to-enable-usb-debugging-mode-on-android.htm

with the usb cable connecting your phone to your computer, run the command:

$./gradlew installDebug
